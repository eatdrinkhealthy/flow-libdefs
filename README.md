# flow-libdefs
A collection of flowtype library definition files (libdefs), to support EDH projects.

These libdefs were created to support projects currently being built / maintained by Eat Drink Healthy. As such, the libdefs may not fully define all items of any given library.

Feel free to use, share, and / or make pull requests.

As time permits, I will add tests, and share suitable libdefs back to the [flow-typed central repository](https://github.com/eatdrinkhealthy/flow-libdefs.git).

## Sources
